# Getting started with Arweave

## **Arweave for developers**

Developers can interact with the core Arweave protocol using its simple HTTP interface. The Arweave community has also built numerous libraries for integrating the protocol in a number of different programming languages.

As part of our focus on [fostering and improving the ecosystem](grants#business_model), the founding Arweave team is proud to offer a number of financial reward programmes to support those building on the Arweave network:

- The [Open Web Hackathon](open_web_hackathon_link): Join the community and earn $200 for building your first open source permaweb app.
- The Arweave [grants and investment](#grants) programme: Propose a grant or investment opportunity to establish your new Arweave based project and we will you help fund it.
- [Arweave Boost](arweave_boost): Want to integrate Arweave into your startup? We are offering up to $50,000 in free storage, access to core Arweave developers, and feedback from top VCs including a16z Crypto and Union Square Ventures.

### Resources

The Arweave community has created a variety of helpful applications and resources to aid users building on the network.

- [Viewblock](): An Arweave block explorer, allowing you to inspect transactions and blocks stored in the network.
- [ar_inspect](): Monitor and inspect data newly mined into the Arweave network.
- [explorer.arweave.co](): Explore transactions associated with apps inside the permaweb.
