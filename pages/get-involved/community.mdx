# Community.

The Arweave community is decentralised, and growing.

Here are a few places where you can connect with other Arweavers:

- The [Arweave Developer Discord](https://discord.gg/BXk8tq7): Maintained and moderated by the founding Arweave team, this platform is a great place to get fast, real-time advice about permaweb app development and integration, Arweave mining, and to discuss ideas and grant proposals.- [Decent-a-Forums](): An asynchronous forum for discussing everything Arweave and permaweb related. The forum is ownerless and runs on the permaweb itself, governed by a decentralised system of content moderation. 

- [Decent-a-Forums](https://dforums.bloc.space): An asynchronous forum for discussing everything Arweave and permaweb related. The forum is ownerless and runs on the permaweb itself, governed by a decentralised system of content moderation. 

- The [Arweave subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Arweave/): A hub of shared links about Arweave and the permaweb. Operated and moderated by the Arweave founding company. 


You can also reach the founding team at any time by [weavemailing us](https://weavemail.app?to=vLRHFqCw1uHu75xqB4fCDW-QxpkpJxBtFD9g4QYUbfw).
