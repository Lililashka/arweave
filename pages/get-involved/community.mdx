# Community

The Arweave community is decentralised.

Here are just a few places that you can find Arweavers:

- The [Arweave Developer Discord](): A real-time communication platform maintained and moderated by the founding Arweave team. This platform is a great place to get fast advice about permaweb app development and integration, Arweave mining, and to discuss ideas.
- [Decent-a-Forums](): An asynchronous forum for discussing everything Arweave and permaweb related. The forum is ownerless and runs on the permaweb itself, governed by a decentralised system of content moderation.
- The [Arweave subreddit](): A hub of shared links about Arweave and the permaweb. Operated and moderated by the Arweave founding company.
- The [Arweave Chat Discord](): A mostly unmoderated real-time discussion server with non-technical chat about the Arweave protocol and token.

You can also reach the founding team at any time by [weavemailing us](https://weavemail.app?to=OUR_ADDRESS).
