# Grants and funding

## **Get paid to build on the permaweb**

We fund developers like you to pursue your vision for applications and integrations built on the Arweave protocol.

All you need to do is [tell us about your great idea](mailto:team@arweave.org?subject=Grant%20Proposal) and we will fund it. Seriously.

## **Previous Grants**

Projects ranging from X to Y have been built with grant assistance. 

- **Weiblocked**: A censorship-resistant archive of censored posts from China's Weibo. By @sam_rahimi.
- **Feedweave**: A decentralised social network and blogging platform. By @literature.
- **The ARCA DAO**: A community run DAO that works to build permaweb apps and improve the Arweave ecosystem. By many.

## **Our business model**

The Arweave is a community owned and operated initiative. The permaweb site you are looking at right now was written by the company that founded the Arweave protocol.

Upon launch the protocol, we claimed ownership to the first tokens in the network. Aside from this stake, we hold no special position or authority in the ecosystem – we are equal community members.

The business model of our company is to invest the proceeds of the slow sale of these tokens into projects and companies that are building inside the Arweave ecosystem. In turn, these projects increase the utility of the Arweave network and subsequently the value of the Arweave tokens that we hold.

This mechanism creates a sustainable business model that enables us to empower Arweave community members to grow the new, decentralised web.


## **Our theses**

We back projects of all types and sizes – from open source apps, to DAOs, to traditional companies. If you have a good idea you want to follow,  [we want to back you](mailto:team@arweave.org?subject=Grant%20Proposal).

Here are some of the grant themes we are especially interested in:

- *Building Information Gold:* [Information is the new oil](https://www.economist.com/leaders/2017/05/06/the-worlds-most-valuable-resource-is-no-longer-oil-but-data). As such, there is no better resource to back a currency with. Build apps and bots to help us fill the Arweave with permanent and verifiable records of all of humanity's valuable knowledge and history.

- *Arweave for businesses:* Permanent and verifiable storage opens immense avenues for value creation in the business world. From verifiable legal contract storage, to data archiving solutions that set a new standard for data integrity, we want to invest in and help companies that build on the Arweave protocol.

- *An open source web:* Once permaweb services are launched, their developers never have to pay for them again. Users of permaweb apps can have confidence that the service will not degrade or change under their feet. This fundamentally changes the game for web service development, allowing us to collectively build an _open source web_.

These are the Arweave founding company's current expectations for how the ecosystem will develop in the short term, but we are always open to your ideas. Simply [let us know](mailto:team@arweave.org?subject=Grant%20Proposal).
