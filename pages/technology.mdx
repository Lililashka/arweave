# Technology.
<br/>

Arweave is a network that connects those with disk space to spare to those  who need permanent data storage. This system offers unparalleled levels of data replication and security for users, as well as financial incentives for data storers, without a middleman.

Rather than operating as a traditional company or foundation, the Arweave network is fully  decentralised,  meaning that anyone can store data in the network or offer storage space, without there being a leader or centralised point of failure. Through decentralization, Arweave offers a new standard of data archiving and storage: one in which information is globally replicated on hundreds of machines, impervious to fire, flood, or intentional damage.

## **Storage Endowment**
Arweave’s data storage is backed by sustainable, transparent economics that allow users to perpetuate the replication of information forever. 

The Arweave’s economic mechanism is similar to a traditional economic endowment structure. When a piece of data is added to the Arweave network, the user pays a ‘principle’ upfront, on which ‘interest’ in the form of storage purchasing power is accrued. 
Over time, interest on this one-time upfront payment is given to those that offer hard drive space so that they can profit from their contributions. By using extremely conservative estimates for storage pricing, Arweave ensures the long-term viability of the network’s endowment. 

For more details regarding the network’s economics, expectations and mathematics, please see chapter ___ of the [yellow paper]().

## **Content Moderation** 
<a className="anchor" id="content-moderation"/>    

Just like the traditional web, abuse of the permaweb is a serious issue. The community of developers and storers that maintain the network treat these issues carefully. Unlike the traditional web, the permaweb has tools for democratic moderation of its content built into the core of the protocol – putting control of the new web back into the hands of the people, users.

When someone submits a transaction to the Arweave network, data storers are given the choice of whether to replicate the associated data. The maintainers of the network are able to filter and screen the transaction in whichever manner they choose, checking against known illicit material, scanning the data with computer vision software, et cetera. You can learn more about how content is moderated in the Arweave protocol in the [yellow paper]().
 
The founding Arweave company is working with the [Internet Watch Foundation](https://www.iwf.org.uk/) to provide the maintainers of the Arweave network with the capabilities that they need to keep their systems and the permaweb safe from abusive material. Data storers can also elect not to replicate any material from the network, for any reason, if they feel that it is inappropriate for storage. Finally, those that maintain gateways (the servers you will likely use to view the permaweb) can also apply content moderation policies to further safeguard their users.

If you would like a piece of content found on an arweave.net gateway to be removed, please contact [this email address](mailto:abuse@arweave.org?subject=Take%20Down%20Request) and you will receive a response shortly.

You can find all of the details of how the Arweave network works in the project’s [yellow paper]().

For historical context, you can also read the June 2018 [Arweave light paper](), and the original August 2017 [Archain whitepaper](). The founding team’s [Arweave blog]() also contains documents and articles about the evolution of the protocol during its early stages.
