# Mining Reward Factors

## **How can I optimise my mining performance?**

Because of the way that the Arweave proof of access system works, miners are favourably rewarded for offering hard drive space above raw hashing power, meaning that efficient miners will optimise on this variable first.  


Hard drive space will become an increasingly important part of the mining process as more data is stored in the system. However, the most efficient miners in the Arweave network will combine all three categories: hard drive space, bandwidth, and computational power.  
We also recommend that you join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/DzNZPaZ) community, as members of our mining channel will be able to offer help on how to best-optimise your efforts

## **How much RAM do I need to dedicate?**

We currently recommend a minimum of 8 GB

## **What factor \(hard drive space/hashing power/network connection\) should I optimise for?**

Because of the way that the Arweave proof of access system works, miners are favourably rewarded for offering hard drive space above raw hashing power. Efficient miners will optimise on this variable first. Hard drive space will become an increasingly important part of the mining process as more data is stored in the system. However, the most efficient miners in the Arweave network will combine all three categories: hard drive space, bandwidth, and computational power

## **Is CPU or GPU mining more effective?**

The hashing algorithm used underneath the proof of access mechanism in the Arweave is SHA2-384, for which the CPU is the most efficient miner currently available
